  An industrious worker drone species, the Chitinid are strong diligent workers. Thanks to their homeworld's environment, they have grown an acute resistance to radiation, but not without its side effects.

  ## Diet
  - Nothing special.

  ## Benefits
  - [color=#1e90ff]Takes 80% less Radiation, 10% less Slash.[/color]
  - Their bodies naturally recover from light radiation damage up to a point. Once they accumulate enough radiation they must purge it from their system in the form of a small rock.
  - Due to their worker drone nature, they are better at pulling and carrying things.
  - Due to their radioactive homeworld, they possess a bio light.

  ## Drawbacks
  - Built for work rather than combat, their hard shells are weaker to Blunt and Piercing damage. [color=#ffa500]They take 25% more piercing and 15% more Blunt damage.[/color]
  - Due to their hard shells, normal syringes can not pierce them, requiring hypos to bypass the toughness.
  - Thanks to their overactive system, they get hungry 33% faster.
  - The cold does not agree with their biology and makes their movement sluggish. [color=#ffa500]The cold also harms them more than others.[/color]
  - They are deceptivly heavy due to their lifestyle and diet.
  - The Chitzite they expel is slightly radioactive.
  - Bug Blood.
