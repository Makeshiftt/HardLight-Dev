  Rodentia are a race of humanoid beings resembling rodents. They are resourceful, evasive, and sneaky, but that comes at the cost of fragile physicality.

  - Can eat raw meat.
  - Will get poisoned by Theobromine (Chocolate, Tea, Coffee) and Allicin (Onion, Garlic).

  - Smaller than humans.
  - Can fit in duffelbags.
